it O

correctly O

our O
Enterprise O
Resource O

, O
so O
the B-Activity Data

must O
be O
transferred B-Activity
manually B-Further Specification

By O
the O
way O
, O
that O
is O
the O
second O
step O
. O
Once O
all O
the O

we O

Once O

we B-Actor

The O
first O
step O

to O
determine B-Activity

This O
can O
be O
achieved O
in O
several O
ways O

Sometimes B-XOR Gateway

we B-Actor
buy B-Activity

our B-Actor
marketing I-Actor

you B-Actor
just O

the I-Activity Data
product I-Activity Data

Then O
we B-Actor
start O
calling B-Activity
the B-Actor
customer I-Actor

That O
is O
done O
by O
the O
call O

They B-Actor
are O
determining B-Activity

the B-Activity Data
budget I-Activity Data

Of O

, O
asking B-Activity

If B-XOR Gateway

If B-XOR Gateway

the O
next O
step O
is O

The O
last O
phase O
is O
the O
creation B-Activity

the B-Actor

Afterwards O

He B-Actor
then O

The B-Actor

If B-XOR Gateway
someone B-Condition Specification

, O
he B-Actor
sends B-Activity

The B-Actor

The O
process O
